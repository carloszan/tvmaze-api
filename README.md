# About

This API responsability is to deliver data that is stored inside a mongodb database.

All the requests are stored in a redis database with a lifespan of 24 hours. This is important because looking up in the database is costly.

I decided to use 24 hours because TvMazeAPI show request has a 24 hours caching, as well.
