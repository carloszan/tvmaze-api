# About

This API responsability is to deliver data that is stored inside a mongodb database.

All the requests are stored in a redis database with a lifespan of 24 hours. This is important because looking up in the database is costly.

I decided to use 24 hours because TvMazeAPI show request has a 24 hours caching, as well.

# Production

This project is running on [https://tvmaze.czar.dev](https://tvmaze.czar.dev).

The only route is implemented is /shows and is paginated as original Tv Maze API.

_Get /shows_

```
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Under the Dome",
        "cast": ...
    },
    ...
]

```

_Get /shows?page=55_
